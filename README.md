**These instructions are for Windows. macOS and Linux instructions may come in the future.**

1. Download this project as a .zip
2. Unzip to a directory of your choice
3. Create a .txt containing all of the words/strings you'd like to search through
4. Install the required modules if you haven't already
5. `cd` to the directory you installed it to
6. run `python Kitsune.py`

If done correctly, Kitsune should begin searching through the .txt you provided. When it's finished, you should see two new .txt files in the `Kitsune` folder. The one called `Available` contains a list of available usernames.

When a user gets banned or deactivates their account, the username they had will show up in `Available`, but will not be able to be set as a username.
